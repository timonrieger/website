Filmhub is a platform for discovering and sharing movies. It is a web application that allows users to rank movies and share them with friends.

## Intention

This was also a project during the 100 days of code challenge. I improved some design but other than that I didn't change much. It's rather a exercise in backend development than a real project. However, for the record I list it here.

## Timeline

Somewhere in the middle of the 100 days of code challenge I started this project. I didn't continue working on it after the challenge.

## Tech Stack

- Backend made with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)
- Frontend made with [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)
