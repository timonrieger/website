Hey, I'm Timon. I'm a...

- ...life time learner
- ...work time developer
- ...free time rebel

You will find me either [working on projects](/projects), [writing](/blog), [reading](/reads), [photographing](/photos) and [tweeting](https://x.com/timonrieger).

**The principles I live by:**

1. learning gives purpose
2. freedom in any way
