## TL;DR
Hey, I'm Timon. I'm a...

- ...life time learner
- ...work time software dev (or let's say tinkerer)
- ...free time self-announced philosopher (does thinking count already?)

You will find me either [working on projects](/projects), [writing](/blog), [reading](/reads), [photographing](/photos) and occasionally [tweeting](https://twitter.com/timonrieger).

If you want to get in touch, you can send me an email at contact@[DOMAIN].de. Replace [DOMAIN] with the domain of this website.

## Principles

Inspired by [The Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python):

1. learning is fun
2. freedom in any way
3. emotions are power
4. silence is unvaluable

## Current Areas of Interest

### Software

I originally started with [Python](https://python.org/) and developed several web applications with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/). 
Although I really appreciate its simplicity and extensibility as a well-established micro web framework, it has its limitations.
Therefore, for my next project, I am turning to more flexible and advanced frameworks, 
such as [Litestar](https://litestar.dev/) for the backend and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) for the frontend.

I am currently learning about servers, Linux and self-hosting. For both interest and privacy reasons, I want to maintain control over my data and be completely independent. 
This is very unfamiliar territory for me, so there is a lot to learn there.
I'll probably start with an old laptop or/and a [Rasperry Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/), install Linux and try to get some Docker apps running.

### Reading

I mainly read older books via my Kindle true to the motto: _The older the problem, the older the solution_.
You can find a list of my readings [here](/reads).

As for shorter reads, I read [random personal blogs](https://indieblog.page/) and a mix of programming, lifestyle and subreddit feeds via [my RSS reader](https://readwise.io/read).

Although I generally don't consume visual content such as movies, entertainment, news programs and (even) sports (somehow I don't miss it), I do enjoy watching some channels on [Freetube](https://freetubeapp.io/).

### Music

I love listening to music at work and during sports, but never when I'm outside and wherever possible without headphones. Firstly, I don't like the passive, disinterested, isolated posture of wearing headphones and secondly, they just never fit me.

Next to listening, I play the piano and occasionally have AI mix a few [house tracks](https://open.spotify.com/artist/15GsOe41GMRA2JthgYP2IB).

My current favorites are:
- [_Gladiator_](https://music.apple.com/de/album/gladiator-soundtrack-from-the-motion-picture/1440563157) soundtrack esp. _Earth_, _The Battle_, _Honor Him_ and _Now We Are Free_ (instantly hooked after watching Gladiator II)

- [_2s n 3s_](https://music.apple.com/de/album/2s-n-3s/1779800598?i=1779801204) (remix of [_Rather Be_](https://music.apple.com/de/album/rather-be-feat-jess-glynne/742117623?i=742117652&l=en-GB) which I really like as a warmup song in the gym)

- [_In Memoriam_](https://music.apple.com/de/album/in-memoriam/1480248207?i=1480248232) by the young russian artist Kirill Richter
