1. learning is fun
2. freedom in any way
3. emotions are power

5. presence is 
6. 

## Rules

## Interests


### Software


### Reading

I mainly read older books via my Kindle according to the motto: _The older the problem, the older the solution_.

As for shorter reads, I read [random personal blogs](https://indieblog.page/) and a mix of programming, lifestyle and subreddit feeds via [my RSS reader](https://readwise.io/read).

You can find an aggregated list of my current reads on [my reads page](/reads).

Although I generally don't consume visual content such as movies, entertainment, news programs and (even) sports (somehow I don't miss it), I do enjoy watching some channels on [Freetube](https://freetubeapp.io/) (local youtube client).


### Music

For me, music is one of the most beautiful things in the world. I love listening to music at work and during sports, but never when I'm outside and wherever possible without headphones. Firstly, I don't like the passive, disinterested, isolated posture of wearing headphones and secondly, they just never fit me.

Next to listening, I play the piano and occasionally have AI mix a few [house tracks](https://open.spotify.com/artist/15GsOe41GMRA2JthgYP2IB).

My current favorites are:
- Gladiator soundtrack esp. _Earth_, _The Battle_, _Honor Him_ and _Now We Are Free_ (instantly hooked after watching Gladiator II)
