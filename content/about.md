- ...free time self-announced philosopher (does thinking count already?)

You will find me either [working on projects](/projects), [writing](/blog), [reading](/reads), [photographing](/photos) and [tweeting](https://x.com/timonrieger).

## Principles

Inspired by [The Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python):

1. learning gives purpose
2. freedom in any way
3. emotions are power
4. silence is unvaluable
5. living means being

## Current Areas of Interest

### Software

I originally started with [Python](https://python.org/) and developed several web applications with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/). 
Lately I have been mostly using [Fastapi](http://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for API development and learning [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) for the frontend.

I am currently learning about servers, Linux and self-hosting. For both interest and privacy reasons, I want to maintain control over my data and be independent. 
This is very unfamiliar territory for me, so there is a lot to learn there.
I am currently playing around with an old HP laptop with Linux Mint installed.

### Reading

I mainly read older [books](/reads#books) via my Kindle true to the motto: _The older the problem, the older the solution_.

As for shorter reads, I casually jump into [random blogs](https://indieblog.page/) and on a daily basis I read [a mix of programming, lifestyle and politics articles](/reads#articles) via [my RSS reader](https://readwise.io/read).

Although I generally don't consume visual content such as movies, entertainment, news programs and (even) sports (somehow I don't miss it), I do enjoy watching some channels on [Freetube](https://freetubeapp.io/).

### Music

I love listening to music at work and during sports, but never when I'm outside and wherever possible without headphones. Firstly, I don't like the passive, disinterested, isolated posture of wearing headphones and secondly, they just never fit me.

Next to listening, I play the piano and occasionally have AI mix a few [house tracks](https://open.spotify.com/artist/15GsOe41GMRA2JthgYP2IB).

My current favorites are:
- [_Gladiator_](https://music.apple.com/de/album/gladiator-soundtrack-from-the-motion-picture/1440563157) ♡ soundtrack by Hans Zimmer esp. _Earth_, _The Battle_, _Honor Him_ and _Now We Are Free_

- [_Wavin' Flag_](https://music.apple.com/de/album/wavin-flag-celebration-mix-feat-f%C3%A9f%C3%A9/1444405394?i=1444405410) as a French remix :D

- [_In Memoriam_](https://music.apple.com/de/album/in-memoriam/1480248207?i=1480248232) by the young russian artist Kirill Richter

- [_All Good Things (Come to an End)_](https://music.apple.com/de/album/all-good-things-come-to-an-end/1445855763?i=1445855888) by Nelly Furtado
