The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius really brought me into the stoic philosophy. After the initial part [life and death](/blog/about-life-and-death) below I'll continue with quotes regarding [life and ethics](/blog/about-life-and-ethics). The next and final post about the book will be about [life and emotions](/blog/about-life-and-emotions).

As a Roman emperor and Stoic, Marcus Aurelius is known for his thoughts and life wisdom, which still inspire many people today. His reflections on life, death, and human nature are definetely timeless.

5 quotes about life and ethics
----------------------------------


> If you follow sound reason and work with zeal, strength and love in what you are about to do, without any other thought guiding you than that of keeping your inner being pure, as if you were soon to give up your spirit; if you pull yourself together in this way, neither hesitating nor hurrying, but allowing yourself to be satisfied with the energy naturally at your disposal and with the truthfulness that must shine forth from every word you utter, you will lead a happy life. And I would not know who could prevent you from doing so.


It emphasizes the importance of a virtuous life and a clear conscience for personal happiness. The quote encourages one to act with determination and integrity, without being distracted by other motives, but solely for the purpose of keeping one's inner self pure. It emphasizes the need to use natural energy and truthfulness to lead a fulfilled and happy life, and expresses the belief that this can be achieved through a consistent focus on moral principles.

> For someone who considers only what happens at the right time to be a good, who is indifferent to whether he has a greater or lesser number of rational actions to show, who makes no distinction between a longer or shorter view of the world, even death is nothing terrible.


It suggests that someone who has the ability to view the events in his life with serenity and wisdom does not perceive death as something terrible. By accepting that both the beautiful and the difficult moments of life are part of a greater whole, one can find an inner peace that also allows death to appear in a different light. This quote emphasizes the importance of serenity and overcoming the fear of the inevitable by living wisely.

> Love what you encounter and what is allotted to you, for what could you do more fairly?


It reminds us that we should accept what happens to us with love and acceptance, as ultimately we have little control over it. It asks us to accept life's challenges as part of our journey and to face them with serenity and dignity.

> To what a first keen eye has taught you, add nothing more. You have learned that some people speak ill of you. Very well. But you have not heard that you are offended. You see, your child is ill. Very well. But you do not see that it is in danger. And so always leave it at the first, and add nothing from within yourself, and nothing will happen to you.


This quote admonishes us not to be influenced by superficial impressions or opinions. It reminds us that we should not overreact when we are spoken badly of or when we are confronted with difficult situations. Instead of getting carried away by our inner thoughts and emotions, we should stay calm and focus on what is really important. It teaches us to maintain composure and clarity in difficult situations in order to protect ourselves from unnecessary suffering.

> But if you do not stop attaching importance to a lot of other things, you are not yet a free, independent, dispassionate person, but are always in a position to be envious and jealous and deceitful against those who possess what you value so highly, and suspicious that someone might want to take it from you, and in despair if you lack it, and full of reproach against the gods. But if it is your attitude alone that constitutes your worth and dignity in your eyes, then you will be able to respect yourself, please those around you and praise and glorify the gods.


It advises you to take a step back in times of excitement or indignation and focus on your own inner strength. It emphasizes the importance of not allowing negative emotions to become excessive and instead striving to regain a harmonious mood of the soul. By learning to regulate your emotions and maintain an inner calm, you become better and better at maintaining this calm even in difficult situations. This leads to a feeling of serenity and inner stability, regardless of external circumstances.
