About Lego
----------


LEGO is a globally recognized brand of construction toys, known for its interlocking plastic bricks. The name "LEGO" comes from the Danish words "leg godt," meaning "play well." LEGO bricks are designed to be versatile and can be assembled and connected in countless ways, allowing children and adults alike to build various structures, vehicles, and imaginative creations.


History of Lego
---------------


Founded by Ole Kirk Christiansen in 1932, the LEGO Group initially crafted wooden toys in Denmark. With a humble start making wooden ducks and yo\-yos, the company transitioned to plastic toys in 1947, setting the stage for its iconic future.


In 1958, LEGO revolutionized the toy industry with the introduction of the modern LEGO brick. Featuring an interlocking design, these bricks offered limitless creative potential, quickly becoming a beloved staple of playtime for children worldwide.


Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, LEGO experienced exponential growth, expanding its product line with new themes and sets. Innovations such as wheels, windows, and minifigures captivated imaginations and propelled LEGO to new heights of popularity.


The 1980s and 1990s saw LEGO embrace themed sets, introducing captivating narratives with LEGO Space, LEGO Castle, and LEGO Pirates. Licensing agreements with franchises like Star Wars and Harry Potter brought beloved characters to life in LEGO form, captivating fans of all ages.


The early 2000s presented challenges for LEGO, with financial difficulties necessitating a significant restructuring effort in 2004\. Streamlining operations and refocusing on its core product, LEGO weathered the storm and emerged stronger than ever.


In the 2010s and beyond, LEGO experienced a renaissance, fueled by innovative new themes, expanded licensing agreements, and ventures into digital media and entertainment. Committed to sustainability and social responsibility, LEGO continues to inspire creativity and play for generations to come.

However, this figure surged to over 800 sets in 2019, reaching a cumulative amount of close to 16,000 sets. Interestingly, there are noticeable fluctuations over time. In the early 2000s, the number of new sets decreased by approximately 30%, persisting until 2006 when a reversal occurred. This decline can be attributed to the company's financial challenges and subsequent restructuring efforts during this time.
