**Who is Marcus Aurelius?**
---------------------------


As a Roman emperor and Stoic, Marcus Aurelius is known for his profound thoughts and life wisdom, which still inspire many people today. His reflections on life, death, and human nature offer timeless insights that are relevant in the modern world. This blog post takes a closer look at some of his most important quotes and their relevance to our lives today.


**7 quotes about life and emotions**
------------------------------------



> Do you want to? then listen to this: Do not get upset and always stay with yourself. If someone has transgressed against you, he has transgressed against himself. If something sad has happened to you: it was destined for you from the beginning; everything that happens is destiny. And all in all: life is short.


It emphasizes the importance of self\-control and inner peace, even in difficult situations. The statement encourages you not to upset yourself and to remain true to yourself, even when faced with challenges. It points out that the behavior of other people or sad events are ultimately part of fate and were predetermined from the outset. Life is portrayed as short and fleeting, which emphasizes the importance of living it to its fullest and with serenity.



> It is not in the soul of another that makes you unhappy, nor in the turn of your external circumstances. Where then, you ask? In your judgment! Do not think it a misfortune, and all will be well. And if what at first surrounds you, your skin is wounded, cut, burned, that part of your being which judges such things must be at rest, that is, it must think that what can affect the good as well as the bad cannot possibly constitute our misfortune or our happiness.


It emphasizes the importance of composure and self\-reflection in difficult situations. The statement encourages people not to let negative emotions get the better of them and to stay true to themselves. It also emphasizes the idea that the actions of others ultimately affect only themselves and that sad events are part of the greater plan of destiny. The realization that life is short adds urgency to this quote, reminding us to use our precious time wisely and focus on what is important.



> If something happens in your surroundings that upsets and outrages you, withdraw into yourself quickly and do not give in unduly to the impressions that jeopardize your attitude. The more often we know how to regain the harmonious mood of the soul, the more capable we become of maintaining it.


It emphasizes the importance of inner attitude and argues that what makes us unhappy does not depend on external circumstances or the actions of others, but on our own judgment about them. The statement emphasizes the power of the mind to keep calm in difficult situations and to maintain the perspective that happiness and unhappiness are ultimately subjective. It encourages examining one's own judgment and not letting external events or other people determine it. By keeping control of your judgment, you can maintain an inner calm regardless of external circumstances.



> As soon as someone has hurt you, you must immediately examine what view of good and evil made him do it. For as soon as this becomes clear to you, you will feel compassion for him and neither be surprised nor angry. Either you will find that you have no essentially different view of good from his, and then you must forgive him. Or you see the difference; but then it is not so difficult to remain kind to him who has erred.


It encourages examining the motives and views of others in order to develop compassion and practice forgiveness. It points out that forgiveness is often possible when one recognizes that one's own ideas of good and evil do not necessarily differ from those of others.



> The sensually perceptible objects are beyond us. They stand alone, so to speak, outside our door. They know nothing about themselves, nor do they judge themselves. So who judges them? The dominant part of our soul.


It describes how the things around us, although they exist, have no opinion or power of judgment of their own. Instead, the power of judgment over them lies with our own mind, specifically the dominant or controlling part of our soul. This reminds us that our perception and interpretation of the world is heavily influenced by our own thoughts, attitudes and beliefs.



> Do not forget that where you live you have quite the same as you would have in the mountains or by the sea or anywhere else you long to go. The shepherd, says Plato, who thus grazes by his fence on the mountain, feels no differently than he who is surrounded by a city wall.


This quote reminds us that our external environment ultimately has less influence on our inner well\-being than our own attitude towards it. It illustrates that the happiness or unhappiness we feel does not depend solely on our physical location, but on our perception and acceptance of what surrounds us. Even if we are in a place that we find less attractive or desirable, we can still find happiness and contentment by changing our attitude and mindset. Ultimately, the true source of our inner state lies within our own mind, regardless of external circumstances.



> And further, that it is not those actions that make us complain, but the ideas we have about them. Send them home and your anger will subside. But how? By considering that what happens to you through them is in truth nothing bad. If it were bad, you yourself would necessarily have been made bad by it." And further, that anger and displeasure at such things weigh us down much more than the things at which you are angry. And finally, that a loving mind, if its love is truly genuine and unfeigned, can be overcome by nothing.


It emphasizes the importance of our own perception and interpretation of events for our emotional well\-being. Marcus Aurelius encourages us to consciously recognize and let go of negative thoughts and ideas that can lead to anger and resentment. By recognizing that our reactions and feelings are primarily dependent on our own thoughts and interpretations, we can overcome our anger and find inner peace. The quote also emphasizes the transformative power of unconditional love and authenticity, which enables us to maintain compassion and serenity even in difficult situations.
