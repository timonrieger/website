The other day, I came across a great video podcast that made me think about biologoy, relationships and happiness. I want to elaborate a bit on my thoughts about the topics that were part of the conversation.

## Quote Of The Day
>The further we distance ourselves from nature, the higher the price we pay in happiness.

I recently came across [Ben](https://www.ungeskriptet.com/about)'s podcast [{ungeskriptet}](https://www.youtube.com/@ben_ungescripted), which has already changed a lot for me. I really enjoy following and learning from the conversations, especially because I think society - myself included - is craving deeper conversations again. Nowadays, there is either no dialog at all, only superficial one or whataboutism and pseudo-tolerance. In my opinion, that's why this podcast resonates so much.

Getting back on topic, the episode I'm referring to is [Men, Women and the Road to Happiness with Soran](https://youtu.be/KhkHvW3TEu0). It's in German, so if you have the privilege of understanding German, I highly recommend it.

What struck me most was how modern society's push for equality, while well-intentioned, sometimes translates into a forced homogenization that ignores fundamental biological realities. This is particularly evident in how we approach gender roles, relationships, and even our basic biology.
