**Who is Marcus Aurelius?**
---------------------------


As a Roman emperor and Stoic, Marcus Aurelius is known for his profound thoughts and life wisdom, which still inspire many people today. His reflections on life, death, and human nature offer timeless insights that are relevant in the modern world. This blog post takes a closer look at some of his most important quotes and their relevance to our lives today.


**7 quotes about life and death**
---------------------------------



> *But death and life, fame and lack of glory, suffering and joy, wealth and poverty and all of these are granted to good and bad people without distinction, as things that constitute neither moral advantages nor moral defects: therefore they are neither good nor evil (neither a blessing nor a misfortune).*


This quote deals with the theme of equality and impartiality of fate towards all people. It states that certain aspects of life, such as death and life, fame and fame, suffering and joy, as well as wealth and poverty, affect every person regardless of their moral merits or deficiencies. The quote argues that these things cannot be considered either good luck or bad luck because they have no direct connection to a person's moral quality. It emphasizes the idea that fate and the external circumstances of life are often independent of personal merit or blame



> *So we have to think about two things: firstly, that everything is essentially the same and follows the same course, and that it makes no difference whether one sees one and the same thing for a hundred or two hundred years or forever. And then that even those who have lived the longest only lose the same as those who die very young. Because it is only the now that one can be deprived of, because this is the only thing one possesses, and no one can lose what he does not have.*


This sentence reflects on the equality and universality of time as well as the transience of all life. The quote emphasizes that every individual's life is ultimately subject to the same fate, regardless of the duration or intensity of their existence. It highlights the importance of the present moment and reminds us that we only own the now and cannot lose what we don't have. It thus invites you to cultivate appreciation and awareness for the present moment



> *Death is the rest from the contradictions of sense perceptions, from the stirrings of our passions, from the developments of our mind and from the service of the flesh*


This quote from Marcus Aurelius reflects the Stoic philosophy of death. He does not view death as something final or terrible, but rather as a kind of liberation from earthly limitations and passions. For him, death means the end of the sensory perceptions, the emotional impulses and the mental hustle and bustle that often accompany life. It is a retreat into silence and calm, free from the distractions and limitations of the physical body. Marcus Aurelius reminds us not to view death as something frightening, but as a natural part of life that frees us from the obstacles and contradictions of the world



> *Soon everything will be with you and soon you will be forgotten by everyone.*


This quote is a reminder that our lives are fleeting and that we will ultimately be forgotten. It emphasizes the vanity of worldly things and reminds us that we should not become too attached to material possessions or fleeting successes. Instead, we should live our lives thoughtfully and create sustainable values ​​that will last beyond our own death.



> *Whatever you do, ask yourself if death is so terrible because it robs you of it.*


This quote encourages reflection on the relative importance and influence of death. It asks you to look at the things you are busy with in relation to the finiteness of life. By accepting death as an inevitable part of life and considering its relative impact on daily affairs, one can develop a more calm and reflective approach to life. Ultimately, this should lead to you setting your own priorities and actions more consciously and allowing yourself to be less influenced by unimportant fears and worries.



> *Think of the nature of the body and soul in which you must let death take hold of you, as well as the shortness of life, the immeasurable time behind you and in front of you, the frailty of every substance.*


It reminds us to recognize the finiteness of our existence and the fragility of the human body and mind. Marcus Aurelius emphasizes the importance of realizing that our lives are limited and that death is inevitable. By contemplating the impermanence of life and the fragility of the body, we can develop a deeper appreciation for life and focus on living each moment consciously. The quote also reminds us that death is a natural part of life and that it is important to be aware of it and prepare for it by clarifying one's values ​​and priorities.



> *Always remind yourself of those who were too sad about something or who caused a great stir through misfortunes, enmities, the greatest positions of honor or other fortunate circumstances. Then present your reflection with the question: “Where is all this now?” It's smoke and ashes, a fairy tale or not even a fairy tale.*


It asks us to remember those who have either overcommitted themselves or experienced great success and fame. Marcus Aurelius suggests thinking about what ultimately remains of all this. He suggests that the things we worry so much about or bring us great joy are ultimately fleeting and often seem less significant when we look at them from a larger perspective. The quote encourages us to see our sorrows and triumphs in a larger context and to recognize that they are ultimately part of life's constant change and impermanence.


**Closing thoughts**
--------------------


Marcus Aurelius' wisdom reminds us to recognize the transience of life and to live consciously. They encourage us to rethink our priorities and focus on what's really important. May the teachings of Marcus Aurelius inspire us to live a fulfilled and conscious life characterized by compassion, serenity and a clear view of reality.
