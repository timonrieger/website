L. Hogan in 2014 about the impact of the Federal Reserve on the US economices:\nHas the Fed Improved U.S. Economic Performance?\nQuote Of The Day Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.\nInflation Rates Increased The average rate of inflation was only 1% in the state banking period and was actually slightly negative at -1% in the national banking period. Average inflation rose to 1.89% in the early Fed period, then 3.93% in the World War II period and as high as 4.41% in the early postwar Fed period. Volatility of Inflation Dropped The overall volatility of inflation in the pre-Fed periods is 5.96 percent, while the standard deviation in the full postwar period is 2.82 percent. High Inflation in the Early Days The WWII period and early postwar period after the FED introduction drive the high inflation rates during the full postwar period. However, inflation rates have higher in the other two periods still range ~2.26% above the pre-FED inflation rates. GDP Growth Dropped GDP in the state banking and national banking periods grew at 4.53 and 3.88%, respectively. The early postwar Fed is slightly lower at 3.23%, and the Great Moderation at 2.74% is more than a full percentage point lower than the pre-Fed periods. The average rate of 4.26 in the full pre-Fed period is also more than a full percentage point higher than the average rate of 3.01 percent in the full post-World War II period. Volatility of GDP Growth Dropped For the full pre-Fed and postwar periods, we see the standard deviation of 2.25 percent in the post-World War II period is lower than the standard deviation of 4.12 percent in the pre-Fed periods. These results indicate that the volatility of GDP growth did improve following World War II, but most of this reduction came during the Great Moderation (1985-2012). High Volatility During WWI and WWII Interestingly, the average GDP growth rate of 5.65 during the World War II period from 1934 to 1952 is higher than in any other period. However, this may be artificially high, since this period begins in 1934, the lowest point of the Great Depression, the recovery from which generated abnormally high rates of growth. Conclusions As seen, the 30 years after 1913 were marked by political instability. One could argue that including this data in the analysis may render it unrepresentative. However, data from the post-war period suggests that similar results apply, albeit with lower significance.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the final conclusion? Is a lower rate of GDP growth volatility better if it requires a higher rate of inflation or a lower long-run rate of GDP growth?\nThe Fed\u0026rsquo;s overall performance is difficult to evaluate because of the tradeoffs between these different aspects of economic performance. Also it is unclear, whether the Great Moderation was caused by factors other than Fed policy.\nMight a decentralized, not discontinued gold-backed monetary standard during the 20th century could have created even greater economic performance than was witnessed during the 19th century?\nIt would be interesting to reassess this study by incorporating data from 2012 to the present, as this could potentially lead to different results.\n","permalink":"https://timonrieger.de/blog/has-the-fed-improved-us-economic-performance/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe introduction of the Federal Reserve in the US in 1913 marked a turning point in US and global economics, followed by the abondance of the gold standard by the Fed in 1933.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to share my learnings from a study published by \u003ca href=\"https://x.com/HoganMonEcon\"\u003eThomas.

I want to elaborate a bit on my thoughts about the topics that were part of the conversation.\nQuote Of The Day The further we distance ourselves from nature, the higher the price we pay in happiness.\nI recently came across Ben\u0026rsquo;s podcast {ungeskriptet}, which has already changed a lot for me. I really enjoy following and learning from the conversations, especially because I think society - myself included - is craving deeper conversations again. Nowadays, there is either no dialog at all, only superficial one or whataboutism and pseudo-tolerance. In my opinion, that\u0026rsquo;s why this podcast resonates so much.\nGetting back on topic, the episode I\u0026rsquo;m referring to is Men, Women and the Road to Happiness. It\u0026rsquo;s in German, so if you have the privilege of understanding German, I highly recommend it.\nWhat struck me most was how modern society\u0026rsquo;s push for equality, while well-intentioned, sometimes translates into a forced homogenization that ignores fundamental biological realities. This is particularly evident in how we approach gender roles, relationships, and even our basic biology.\nWhile people talk about equality, what they are really talking about is equalization. I explain this by looking at what is actually meant by the word equality between the sexes. In my opinion, the problem with this whole social debate starts with the definition of equality. If you look it up in non-scientific encyclopedias like Wikipedia, it is defined as follows: \u0026ldquo;Equality generally refers to the fact of being equal, of having the same value.\u0026rdquo; (ao. 04/2025). While the word \u0026ldquo;equality\u0026rdquo; itself suggests that especially the first part of this definition is accurate, I believe it rather means: \u0026ldquo;The right to be equal\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;The concession of having the same rights\u0026rdquo;.\nThe difference is subtle, but note the little word \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo;, in the sense of freedom to do something. The first part of the Wikipedia definition suggests that the two biological sexes are effectively the same, which is false. I agree with the second part. But I don\u0026rsquo;t know whether this is objectively the case in reality, so I won\u0026rsquo;t say any more here.\nSince this is the general definition of \u0026ldquo;equality\u0026rdquo; and I am writing specifically about gender equality, Wikipedia defines gender equality as \u0026ldquo;(\u0026hellip;) the state of having equal access to resources and opportunities regardless of gender (\u0026hellip;)\u0026rdquo;, which is definitely invalidates my prior interpretation to some extent and is far from the general definition.\nIn my opinion, however, this definition is used as a justification for gender equalization policies, which we see, for example, in the form of quotas for women. The emancipation process of women is the real driver in the background, although this process started hundreds of years ago. Emancipation and equality sound great, but what about when it actually comes to equalization? This is simply not possible, because men and women are not the same, they are biologically different.\nIf you bring these biologically different forms of the human species so close together, you will also distance them from their natural origins, to stay with the quote above. The social acceptance of the female man and the male woman dominates social attention.\nAnd the consequence of this is that both tend to become unhappier because they distance themselves from their original biology.\n","permalink":"https://timonrieger.de/blog/biology-is-intentional/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe other day, I came across a great video podcast that made me think about biologoy, relationships and happiness.

Nevertheless, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to deprive you of my findings of simulating the strategy. In the first post, we looked at 14 seasons of Bundesliga data to analyze patterns in match results, goal times and odds trends.\nOur Strategy The strategy I will be backtesting today will be betting on over 0.5 goals in the 30th minute if until then no goal has been scored. At the time of writing the odds with these conditions average at around 1.2. The odds are crucial to the profitability of this strategy, so keep that in mind. I will walk you through my analysis and thoughts when writing the code for it. You can find the unfortunately unorganized notebook and the data for this study on Github.\nFor the following study, I used a technique called hyperparameter optimization, which is a common method in Machine Learning to systematically adjust the parameters of a model to improve its performance on a specific task, such as enhancing accuracy, reducing error rates, or optimizing computational efficiency. In my case, I tried to optimize the following parameters to achieve the highest chance of being profitable with my betting strategy:\nx: margin per bet in percent (1-100%) y: max win series before securing profits (1-20) z: cashout after y winning bets (1-100%) Essentially I wanted to see with how much margin x I should bet and after how many winning bets y I should cash out z percent. The idea is that you start with let\u0026rsquo;s say 100$ initial investments with x=10%, y=5, and z=50%. I would start with 10$ on the first bet. If won I would keep betting with the money I made from the first bet. So if the odds had been 1.16 when I entered the bet, I would now bet with 11.6$ on the second bet. Let\u0026rsquo;s say I win 5 (y) bets in a row, assuming the odds are 1.16 on all bets I would have 90$ on my account + 20.1$ in my bet. After the winning streak of 5 bets. I would cash out 50% of the 20.1$ to my account balance, bringing me to 100.05$ on my account and 10.05$ left for the sixth bet. You might ask why I didn\u0026rsquo;t optimize for a simple x% margin per bet, like 10% on every bet for example. As this strategy will have lots of winning bets, as the odds are very small (~1.16), I wanted to have an additional compounding effect in it. I am aware that this adds additional risk, but potentially higher returns in the long run. Additionally, the simple approach has been neutralized by the betting service with a higher probability than my more complex approach. In the end, we have to keep in mind that we essentially try to find a hole in the betting services\u0026rsquo;s calculations, which is not easy and possibly not manageable to do so.\nGoing back to my parameter optimization. By running all 210.000 combinations of the params I found out that the best settings are the following: x = 23%, y = 6, z = 40%. The following graphs will now always use these settings to perform the simulations of my strategy.\nSimulation Results Balance Over Time for Each Simulation This graph shows the balance trajectory for individual simulations. Each line represents one of 1000 simulations of betting on matches with specific odds. The y-axis depicts the balance, and the x-axis tracks the progression of bets placed. The wild fluctuations in the beginning reflect how randomness significantly impacts short-term results. However, some trajectories stabilize over time, revealing the potential for consistent profitability under the right conditions.\nDistribution of Bets Before Losing All Money The histogram shows most simulations end quickly, as seen in the high density on the left side. Outliers skew the mean (red line), indicating in some simulations the money lasts significantly longer than average. The quartiles (q1, q2, q3) provide a clearer representation of typical performance, with the second quartile (q2) aligning closer to the majority’s outcomes. This emphasizes the median as a better indicator of the typical bettor’s experience over the mean. However we also see that about 20% of the simulations pass the 2000 bets and never suffer a total loss. A further interesting exploration would be checking how many bets are placed on average per season to make that chart more accessible.\nMedian Simulation Results This plot depicts the balance progression for the median simulation result. The strategy leads to losses early on, but after about 150 bets, the balance stabilizes. The eventual upward trend indicates a potential recovery phase, though the risk of bankroll depletion remains significant. The mean result differs significantly from the median. A small subset of simulations performed exceptionally well as seen in the first graph, skewing the mean and suggesting having found a really great strategy. It’s a good reminder to assess both mean and median performance metrics when evaluating a strategy.\nConclusion It seems like this strategy can be sort of profitable as seen in the last graph. Nevertheless, we have seen the huge variations of the simulations, so in the end, it seems to be a gamble. You might call it \u0026ldquo;roulette with a minimal higher chance of winning\u0026rdquo;. Also note that we have chosen the best parameters in the backtest, so we may have fallen victim to the hindsight effect. I hope you enjoyed this study!\nAll graphics were created by me using Python and are available for non-commercial use. Please note that the analysis and calculations presented here may contain errors.\n","permalink":"https://timonrieger.de/blog/building-a-betting-strategy-2/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s been a while and the teams are already deep into the Bundesliga season.

This strategy would have easily outperformed holding bitcoin, as we would have sold at each cycle top and reinvested everything in the bear market. I will use this plan for altcoins as well, as they are highly correlated with bitcoin, making it difficult to predict the exact top for each coin. This approach may limit maximum profits, but it helps to secure them.\nThis strategy is based on the ColinTalksCrypto Bitcoin Bullrun Index (CBBI). The CBBI is a Bitcoin index that utilizes advanced, real-time analysis of 9 metrics to help us understand what stage of the Bitcoin bull run and bear market cycles we are in. The confidence score indicates whether we are approaching the top/bottom of a blow-off Bitcoin cycle. The CBBI algorithm and website are 100% open source. This makes CBBI different from other Bitcoin price indexes. I would highly suggest, having a look into the CBBI yourself.\nStrategy Logic Buying: Begin accumulation if CBBI is below 10. The accumulation period spans 30 to 150 days, typically averaging 70-80 days. Divide your predetermined investment into 2% increments and invest daily when the buying condition is met. Selling: Sell 10% of your holdings on the 7th consecutive day that CBBI stays above 80. Sell 20% on the 7th consecutive day that CBBI remains above 85, provided the selling price is at least 10% higher than your last sell.

Let´s analyze some historical data and develop a thesis. We will be using data from OpenLigaDB from 2009/10 to 2023/24 and explore statistics like the distribution of match outcomes, results by winning team, and scoring times.\nIn this post, the data is processed and visualized using Python, Plotly and Matplotlib. Our aim is to uncover trends and patterns that will be useful for a follow-up post on value betting strategies, focusing specifically on bets on more than 0.5 goals.\nThis pie chart displays the distribution of the most common match outcomes in Bundesliga games from the 2009/10 season to the 2023/24 season. Each slice of the pie represents a different match outcome, with the size of each slice indicating the proportion of matches that ended with that specific scoreline.\n1:1 Leading for 14 Seasons This graph is a stacked area chart showing the changes in the percentages of the top 10 most common Bundesliga match results from 2009 to 2023. The x-axis represents the years, while the y-axis indicates the percentage of matches that ended in each specific result. Each color in the chart corresponds to a specific match result, such as 1:1, 2:1, 2:0, and so on. The 1:1 result is the most common throughout the period, consistently occupying the largest area. The results 2:1, 2:0, and 1:0 also frequently appear, indicating their regular occurrence in matches. There is a noticeable increase in 2:0 and 2:1 outcomes around 2014-2018, while 0:0 results slightly decrease post-2020. The overall percentage of these top 10 results remains high, often surpassing 70%, showing their dominance in match outcomes.\nThis pie chart illustrates the distribution of Bundesliga match outcomes by the winning team from the 2009/10 season to the 2023/24 season. The chart is divided into three sections, each representing a different type of match result: home win, away win, and draw. Why Home Teams Win More Often Playing at home provides teams with the advantage of familiar surroundings, including the pitch, changing rooms, and even the local climate. Additionally, home teams benefit from the support of their local fans, which can boost player morale and create an intimidating atmosphere for the visiting team. The reduction in travel fatigue also plays a crucial role, as away teams often have to travel long distances, which can affect their performance. Lastly, referees, albeit subconsciously, may be influenced by the home crowd, potentially leading to favorable decisions for the home team. These factors combined contribute to the higher percentage of home wins in the Bundesliga.\nMost First Goals are Scored between the 5th and 12th Minute This histogram illustrates the distribution of the first goal timing in Bundesliga matches from the 2009/10 season to the 2023/24 season. The x-axis represents the minute of the match when the first goal was scored, and the y-axis represents the count or frequency of matches that had their first goal scored at each minute.\nThe chart shows that the majority of first goals are scored within the first 30 minutes of the match, with the highest frequency occurring between the 4th and 20th minutes. There is a noticeable peak around the 10th minute, indicating that first goals are commonly scored early in the match. After the initial 30 minutes, the frequency of first goals decreases steadily as the match progresses. Fewer first goals are scored in the latter stages of the first half and during the second half of the match. The red dashed line on the chart represents the average timing of the first goal, which is around the 29th minute. The Precision in Calculating Betting Odds This graph illustrates the relationship between the probability of a 0:0 draw and the odds for over 0.5 goals across different minutes of a match. The x-axis represents the minutes of the game, ranging from 0 to 45, while the left y-axis shows the probability percentage, and the right y-axis displays the odds. The blue line represents the increasing probability of a 0:0 draw as the match progresses, starting at around 6% and reaching up to nearly 24%.\nThe green line shows the odds for over 0.5 goals, which also rise as time passes, starting just above 1.07 and climbing to around 1.29. Both lines follow a similar upward trend, indicating that as the game progresses, both the likelihood of a 0:0 draw and the odds for over 0.5 goals increase. The alignment of the two lines suggests a close correlation between the rising probability of a draw and the changing odds for goals. This graph effectively shows how in-play betting odds and probabilities adjust as a match moves towards halftime. As you can see the odds for over 0.5 goals are always below the probabilit that there won\u0026rsquo;t be any goals in the match. Can you even win on the long run?\nThis series of pie charts illustrates the distribution of match outcomes in the Bundesliga based on the time when the score remains 0:0. Each pie chart represents a different minute interval, starting from minute 0 up to minute 95. Initially, the match outcomes are diverse, with a variety of scores being equally probable. As the game progresses, the probability of a 0:0 draw increases significantly, especially after the 60th minute. By the 90th minute, the 0:0 draw becomes the most dominant outcome, comprising over 90% of the results. This trend highlights that as more time passes without a goal, the likelihood of the match ending in a 0:0 draw increases substantially.\nConclusion I hope you enjoyed reading this!

Although 99.9% of these groups are definitely scams and don\u0026rsquo;t work at all, I wanted to review how a select group has performed in the past. Note that this is not a public group, but a paid group that I will be backtesting. I got access to this group through my work colleague whose company has access to this group.\nDisclaimer The script and analysis presented in this post have not been verified by external parties. The results of my analysis may be inaccurate, as there might be factors I did not consider in my calculations. There may also be a significant tracking error compared to the \u0026ldquo;index\u0026rdquo; (the signals). You should conduct your own research, and please note that this is not financial advice.\nYou can view all the code used in this study on Github.\nAbout the Signals The signals of the Telegram Channel I analyzed looked like this: 📩 #ARUSDT Long | Entry: 28.658 Strategy name: #ARUSDT ARUSDT15-15USDTPERP - Binance Futures | 15 min timeframe — 📤 Signal details — Target 1 : 29.23 probability 100% Target 2 : 29.80 probability 92% Target 3 : 30.38 probability 86% Target 4 : 32.10 probability 72% ⛔ Stop-Loss: 25.79 or opposite signal 🔀 or add more at the dip 🔽 🏦 Leverage: 10x cross If you\u0026rsquo;re new to crypto, here is a brief explanation of the terms used in the trading signals:\nTrading Pair: AR/USDT (trading Arweave against USD Tether coin) Trading Direction: Long (profiting from an increase in value) Entry: 28.658 (the entry price for the trade) Targets/Take Profits (TP): 29.23, 29.80, 30.38, 32.10 (prices at which to close the trade and secure profits) Stop-Loss (SL): 25.79 (price at which to close the trade to limit your loss) Leverage: 10 (if you invest $100 with a leverage of 10, your position is $1000 in size) Our Strategy While the signal gives us the take profit and stop loss, we can still adjust our strategy around it. After some testing with different approaches, I have found that the following one gives the best risk-adjusted profits.\nNormally this is not the best approach as you don\u0026rsquo;t know the best approach at the beginning (hindsight). However, I have decided on this idea, so take it with a grain of salt.\nThe strategy includes 4 take profit targets that decrease exponentially as positions are closed. In addition, a trailing stop mechanism is used which continuously adjusts the stop loss to the last target reached. When the first profit target is reached, the stop is moved to break-even; when the second target is reached, it is adjusted to the first target price and so on.\nProcedure of the Backtest Data Preparation Export Telegram Channel Data: Extract the data from the Telegram channel. Filter Relevant Messages: Identify and filter messages that contain trading signals. Extract Trade Information: Parse each relevant message to extract trade details. Organize Trade Information: Store the extracted trade details in a JSON file. Trade Simulation Enter the Trade: Simulate entering the trade based on the entry price. Check for SL and TPs: Monitor the trade to determine if it hits the stop-loss or any of the profit targets. Calculate ROI: Compute the return on investment (profit or loss) for each trade. Record Results: Add the ROI along with the trade\u0026rsquo;s closing date to a CSV file. Data Analysis Group ROI by Date: Aggregate the ROI data by date to calculate the average profit or loss per day. Plot Average ROI: Create a plot of the average daily ROI and include the mean value to indicate overall profitability (excluding trading fees). Set Trading Parameters: Define trading parameters such as fees, margin, etc. Calculate Portfolio Balance: Compute the day-over-day portfolio balance applying the defined parameters. Calculate Risk Parameters: Evaluate risk metrics like volatility and Sharpe ratio. Plot Account Balance: Visualize the account balance over time for each trade to assess strategy performance in a practical environment, including trading fees. Results of the Backtest I have analyzed data from approximately May 2023 to today, which results in 2431 trades in 358 trading days. This essentially means that a trade has taken place almost every day with an average of 6.8 trades per day. To be honest, the results look really good. As you can see, the average trade yields a profit of 2.85%, which is going to increase insanely over time. But since this is too good to be true, there must be a catch, right? Yes, of course, and that is that the fees are excluded. So let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at what happens when you subtract the fees and add a little more spice with leverage.\nWe examine parameters such as taker fee, maker fee, funding fee, margin, and leverage. The Taker fee, typically between 0.04% and 0.06% of the position size, is charged when entering a trade. The Maker fee, about half the size of the taker fee, is charged upon trade closure. For simplicity, I\u0026rsquo;ve assumed a conservative total taker fee of 0.1%. The funding fee and average funding cycles per trade occur every 8 hours, transferring payments between Short Traders and Long Traders, based on trade duration. With an average trade open for one day, this equates to approximately 3 funding cycles (24h / 8h). Margin represents the percentage of the account balance used for trading (e.g., 0.02 for 2%). Leverage multiplies fees based on the position size, not the initial investment margin.\nINITIAL = 1000 MARGIN = 0.02 # 2% TAKER_FEE = 0.001 # 0.1% FUNDING_FEE = 0.0002 # 0.02% LEVERAGE = 10 AVG_FUNDING_CYCLES_PER_TRADE = 3 # 24h Avg. Trade Length If we now add the compounding mechanism by adding each absolute trading profit, we get the account balance over time, starting with 1k initial deposit:\nAs seen above, this strategy appears to be profitable. Before fees and trading parameters are taken into account, it generates an average daily return of 2.85%. Using these parameters, an initial investment of $1000 on May 1, 2023 would generate a return of $2,500 by June 18, 2024.\nImportant: Although this backtest seems to outperform Bitcoin by 23% over the same period (150%+ return compared to 127%), the Sharpe Ratio in the top left is close to 0, which means that the risk-adjusted statistic is not really good.\nConclusion I hope you found this study interesting! Please remain skeptical and do not rely on this study as errors may have occurred. However, it shows that not every Telegram Crypto Signals Group is ineffective.\nI would not recommend going with any of these groups. Either learn to trade yourself, just HODL Bitcoin like Michael Saylor does, or check out Crypticorn, a machine learning approach to crypto trading that I am heavily involved in.\n","permalink":"https://timonrieger.de/blog/5-backtesting-crypto-trading-signals/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re into finance-related content on YouTube, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably seen all these ads where someone is making 20k a month with their crypto signals and that you should definitely join their Telegram group too.

The last post about Marcus Aurelius\u0026rsquo; meditations might plant some seeds for you in this regard.\nAs a Roman emperor and Stoic, Marcus Aurelius is known for his profound thoughts and life wisdom, which still inspire many people today. His reflections on life, death, and human nature offer timeless insights that are relevant in the modern world. This blog post takes a closer look at some of his most important quotes and their relevance to our lives today.\n7 quotes about life and emotions Do you want to? then listen to this: Do not get upset and always stay with yourself. If someone has transgressed against you, he has transgressed against himself. If something sad has happened to you: it was destined for you from the beginning; everything that happens is destiny. And all in all: life is short.\nIt emphasizes the importance of self-control and inner peace, even in difficult situations. The statement encourages you not to upset yourself and to remain true to yourself, even when faced with challenges. It points out that the behavior of other people or sad events are ultimately part of fate and were predetermined from the outset. Life is portrayed as short and fleeting, which emphasizes the importance of living it to its fullest and with serenity.\nIt is not in the soul of another that makes you unhappy, nor in the turn of your external circumstances. Where then, you ask? In your judgment! Do not think it a misfortune, and all will be well. And if what at first surrounds you, your skin is wounded, cut, burned, that part of your being which judges such things must be at rest, that is, it must think that what can affect the good as well as the bad cannot possibly constitute our misfortune or our happiness.\nIt emphasizes the importance of composure and self-reflection in difficult situations. The statement encourages people not to let negative emotions get the better of them and to stay true to themselves. It also emphasizes the idea that the actions of others ultimately affect only themselves and that sad events are part of the greater plan of destiny. The realization that life is short adds urgency to this quote, reminding us to use our precious time wisely and focus on what is important.\nIf something happens in your surroundings that upsets and outrages you, withdraw into yourself quickly and do not give in unduly to the impressions that jeopardize your attitude. The more often we know how to regain the harmonious mood of the soul, the more capable we become of maintaining it.\nIt emphasizes the importance of inner attitude and argues that what makes us unhappy does not depend on external circumstances or the actions of others, but on our own judgment about them. The statement emphasizes the power of the mind to keep calm in difficult situations and to maintain the perspective that happiness and unhappiness are ultimately subjective. It encourages examining one\u0026rsquo;s own judgment and not letting external events or other people determine it. By keeping control of your judgment, you can maintain an inner calm regardless of external circumstances.\nAs soon as someone has hurt you, you must immediately examine what view of good and evil made him do it. For as soon as this becomes clear to you, you will feel compassion for him and neither be surprised nor angry. Either you will find that you have no essentially different view of good from his, and then you must forgive him. Or you see the difference; but then it is not so difficult to remain kind to him who has erred.\nIt encourages examining the motives and views of others in order to develop compassion and practice forgiveness. It points out that forgiveness is often possible when one recognizes that one\u0026rsquo;s own ideas of good and evil do not necessarily differ from those of others.\nThe sensually perceptible objects are beyond us. They stand alone, so to speak, outside our door. They know nothing about themselves, nor do they judge themselves. So who judges them? The dominant part of our soul.\nIt describes how the things around us, although they exist, have no opinion or power of judgment of their own. Instead, the power of judgment over them lies with our own mind, specifically the dominant or controlling part of our soul. This reminds us that our perception and interpretation of the world is heavily influenced by our own thoughts, attitudes and beliefs.\nDo not forget that where you live you have quite the same as you would have in the mountains or by the sea or anywhere else you long to go. The shepherd, says Plato, who thus grazes by his fence on the mountain, feels no differently than he who is surrounded by a city wall.\nThis quote reminds us that our external environment ultimately has less influence on our inner well-being than our own attitude towards it. It illustrates that the happiness or unhappiness we feel does not depend solely on our physical location, but on our perception and acceptance of what surrounds us. Even if we are in a place that we find less attractive or desirable, we can still find happiness and contentment by changing our attitude and mindset. Ultimately, the true source of our inner state lies within our own mind, regardless of external circumstances.\nAnd further, that it is not those actions that make us complain, but the ideas we have about them. Send them home and your anger will subside. But how? By considering that what happens to you through them is in truth nothing bad. If it were bad, you yourself would necessarily have been made bad by it.\u0026quot; And further, that anger and displeasure at such things weigh us down much more than the things at which you are angry. And finally, that a loving mind, if its love is truly genuine and unfeigned, can be overcome by nothing.\nIt emphasizes the importance of our own perception and interpretation of events for our emotional well-being. Marcus Aurelius encourages us to consciously recognize and let go of negative thoughts and ideas that can lead to anger and resentment. By recognizing that our reactions and feelings are primarily dependent on our own thoughts and interpretations, we can overcome our anger and find inner peace. The quote also emphasizes the transformative power of unconditional love and authenticity, which enables us to maintain compassion and serenity even in difficult situations.\nClosing thoughts Marcus Aurelius\u0026rsquo; wisdom reminds us to recognize the transience of life and to live consciously. They encourage us to rethink our priorities and focus on what\u0026rsquo;s really important. May the teachings of Marcus Aurelius inspire us to live a fulfilled and conscious life characterized by compassion, serenity and a clear view of reality.\nAnd that brings us to the end of our journey through Marcus Aurelius\u0026rsquo; most important teachings and quotes. I hope you have learned something new, gained an insight or better understood a certain concept.\nAll quotes used in this post come from the work \u0026ldquo;The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius\u0026rdquo;.

His reflections on life, death, and human nature are definetely timeless.\n5 quotes about life and ethics If you follow sound reason and work with zeal, strength and love in what you are about to do, without any other thought guiding you than that of keeping your inner being pure, as if you were soon to give up your spirit; if you pull yourself together in this way, neither hesitating nor hurrying, but allowing yourself to be satisfied with the energy naturally at your disposal and with the truthfulness that must shine forth from every word you utter, you will lead a happy life. And I would not know who could prevent you from doing so.\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s really the key. Focus on the one thing you\u0026rsquo;re doing right now, be gracious to yourself and calm about anything that comes your way. Nature has taken care of that for you.\nFor someone who considers only what happens at the right time to be a good, who is indifferent to whether he has a greater or lesser number of rational actions to show, who makes no distinction between a longer or shorter view of the world, even death is nothing terrible.\nI think this means don\u0026rsquo;t look to far outside of your environment if you are searching for ways to benchmark the good or bad of your actions. It does not matter.\nLove what you encounter and what is allotted to you, for what could you do more fairly?\nThis goes in a similar direction to the previous point. By nature, people tend to overvalue what others have, but undervalue what they themselves possess.\nTo what a first keen eye has taught you, add nothing more. You have learned that some people speak ill of you. Very well. But you have not heard that you are offended. You see, your child is ill. Very well. But you do not see that it is in danger. And so always leave it at the first, and add nothing from within yourself, and nothing will happen to you.\nInteresting. Overinterpretation and overthinking is not a resource-conserving approach, as you always imagine negative scenarios that never materialize or are irrelevant anyway.\nBut if you do not stop attaching importance to a lot of other things, you are not yet a free, independent, dispassionate person, but are always in a position to be envious and jealous and deceitful against those who possess what you value so highly, and suspicious that someone might want to take it from you, and in despair if you lack it, and full of reproach against the gods. But if it is your attitude alone that constitutes your worth and dignity in your eyes, then you will be able to respect yourself, please those around you and praise and glorify the gods.\nFor me viewing everything with a little smile helps overcome the emotional attachement.

You are reading about life and death and there is about life and emotions and about life and ethics, too.\nAs a Roman emperor and Stoic, Marcus Aurelius is known for his thoughts and life wisdom, which still inspire many people today. His reflections on life, death, and human nature are definetely timeless.\n7 quotes about life and death But death and life, fame and lack of glory, suffering and joy, wealth and poverty and all of these are granted to good and bad people without distinction, as things that constitute neither moral advantages nor moral defects: therefore they are neither good nor evil (neither a blessing nor a misfortune).\nAgreed. Does that mean you should withdraw from your emotional assumptions? I guess so: \u0026ldquo;There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so\u0026rdquo; ~ Shakespeare\nSo we have to think about two things: firstly, that everything is essentially the same and follows the same course, and that it makes no difference whether one sees one and the same thing for a hundred or two hundred years or forever. And then that even those who have lived the longest only lose the same as those who die very young. Because it is only the now that one can be deprived of, because this is the only thing one possesses, and no one can lose what he does not have.\nYou can only lose, what you possess. In your opinion, is it worse if a 20-year-old or an 80-year-old dies? Why is that important? Can you step back from your reasoning and look at the issue without emotionality?\nDeath is the rest from the contradictions of sense perceptions, from the stirrings of our passions, from the developments of our mind and from the service of the flesh\nDeath as a form of liberation. Interesting. Have you ever thought about how death feels (if that makes sense\u0026hellip;)? Try to feel it if you haven\u0026rsquo;t.\nSoon everything will be with you and soon you will be forgotten by everyone.\nI feel this is very liberating and pressuring at the same time. What do you feel by understanding this?\nWhatever you do, ask yourself if death is so terrible because it robs you of it.\nI wonder if you are afraid of death\u0026hellip;if so, why? If not, why not?\nThink of the nature of the body and soul in which you must let death take hold of you, as well as the shortness of life, the immeasurable time behind you and in front of you, the frailty of every substance.\n\u0026hellip;and\nAlways remind yourself of those who were too sad about something or who caused a great stir through misfortunes, enmities, the greatest positions of honor or other fortunate circumstances. Then present your reflection with the question: “Where is all this now?” It\u0026rsquo;s smoke and ashes, a fairy tale or not even a fairy tale.\nYou are dust. I am dust.

The name \u0026ldquo;LEGO\u0026rdquo; comes from the Danish words \u0026ldquo;leg godt,\u0026rdquo; meaning \u0026ldquo;play well.\u0026rdquo; LEGO bricks are designed to be versatile and can be assembled and connected in countless ways, allowing children and adults alike to build various structures, vehicles, and imaginative creations.\nHistory of Lego Founded by Ole Kirk Christiansen in 1932, the LEGO Group initially crafted wooden toys in Denmark. With a humble start making wooden ducks and yo-yos, the company transitioned to plastic toys in 1947, setting the stage for its iconic future.\nIn 1958, LEGO revolutionized the toy industry with the introduction of the modern LEGO brick. Featuring an interlocking design, these bricks offered limitless creative potential, quickly becoming a beloved staple of playtime for children worldwide.\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, LEGO experienced exponential growth, expanding its product line with new themes and sets. Innovations such as wheels, windows, and minifigures captivated imaginations and propelled LEGO to new heights of popularity.\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw LEGO embrace themed sets, introducing captivating narratives with LEGO Space, LEGO Castle, and LEGO Pirates. Licensing agreements with franchises like Star Wars and Harry Potter brought beloved characters to life in LEGO form, captivating fans of all ages.\nThe early 2000s presented challenges for LEGO, with financial difficulties necessitating a significant restructuring effort in 2004. Streamlining operations and refocusing on its core product, LEGO weathered the storm and emerged stronger than ever.\nIn the 2010s and beyond, LEGO experienced a renaissance, fueled by innovative new themes, expanded licensing agreements, and ventures into digital media and entertainment. Committed to sustainability and social responsibility, LEGO continues to inspire creativity and play for generations to come.\nHow many LEGO sets have been released each year? This graph illustrates the annual release of LEGO sets over time. Initially, the number of sets released per year was modest, with fewer than 10 sets in the early years. However, this figure surged to over 800 sets in 2019, reaching a cumulative amount of close to 16,000 sets. Interestingly, there are noticeable fluctuations over time. In the early 2000s, the number of new sets decreased by approximately 30%, persisting until 2006 when a reversal occurred. This decline can be attributed to the company\u0026rsquo;s financial challenges and subsequent restructuring efforts during this time.\nWhat is the average number of pieces in a LEGO set? This graph illustrates the complexity of LEGO sets over time by showcasing the average number of pieces in each set for a given year. The overarching trend reveals an increase in set complexity over the years. Initially, builders contended with constructing sets containing around 50 pieces, a figure that has quadrupled since. Particularly notable is the surge in complexity during the early 2000s, where sets nearly doubled in piece count compared to preceding years. The grey line represents a 5-year moving average, serving as a trend line to elucidate long-term patterns in set complexity.\nWhich LEGO set has the highest piece count? Our graph highlights the LEGO set with the highest piece count. Each bar represents a different LEGO set, with its length reflecting the number of pieces in the set. It\u0026rsquo;s noteworthy that all of these sets were released after 2015, reaffirming the trend of growing complexity in LEGO designs.\nWhat LEGO theme has the highest number of sets? Our graph visually depicts the distribution of LEGO sets across various themes, revealing which theme boasts the highest number of sets. Each bar represents a different theme, with the height of the bar indicating the number of sets within that theme.\nWhat is the most common LEGO color? The bar chart visually illustrates the popularity of the top 10 LEGO colors, highlighting their frequency of use. For instance, black comprises 18% of all existing LEGO parts, red 7% and tan 3%. These 10 colors, out of a total of 267, are the most commonly utilized by designers.\nThe data presented in this post is sourced directly from The LEGO Group provided by Rebrickable.
