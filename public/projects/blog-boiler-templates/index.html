<meta name=keywords content><meta name=description content="Blog Boiler is a set of two templates to get started with a free, easy and predesigned blog template that will help you get started blogging in minutes.
Before I switched my blog to Hugo I had been using the Pro template myself. You can find more detailed information about usage on Github, Pro and Lite version
Intention
I started this project during the 100 Days of Code challenge. It was a long-term project spanning several days, implementing various features over time. While the design itself is not my own, I was drawn to the idea of having a self-hosted space where I could write about my ideas and thoughts. I continued developing it over time, adapting it to my needs.
Initially, it used JSON storage via npoint for blog posts, which is still being used in the Lite version. Later, I enhanced the Pro version by adding a PostgreSQL database for blog posts to enable basic CRUD operations, along with features like tags, user management, and comments. I maintained my own instance of the Pro version running alongside the Lite and Pro templates for a while. Recently, I migrated the blog to Hugo and have since discontinued development and usage of this project."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://timonrieger.de/projects/blog-boiler-templates/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.2fe458a3004f8122f56c00eeaae85d03fd6036018b5ff83371839dbc87d5e2de.css integrity="sha256-L+RYowBPgSL1bADuquhdA/1gNgGLX/gzcYOdvIfV4t4=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://timonrieger.de/assets/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://timonrieger.de/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://timonrieger.de/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://timonrieger.de/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://timonrieger.de/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://timonrieger.de/projects/blog-boiler-templates/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://timonrieger.de/projects/blog-boiler-templates/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="timonrieger.de"><meta property="og:title" content="Blog Boiler Templates"><meta property="og:description" content="Blog Boiler is a set of two templates to get started with a free, easy and predesigned blog template that will help you get started blogging in minutes.
