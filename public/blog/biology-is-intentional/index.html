I want to elaborate a bit on my thoughts about the topics that were part of the conversation.\nQuote Of The Day The further we distance ourselves from nature, the higher the price we pay in happiness.\nI recently came across Ben’s podcast {ungeskriptet}, which has already changed a lot for me. I really enjoy following and learning from the conversations, especially because I think society - myself included - is craving deeper conversations again. Nowadays, there is either no dialog at all, only superficial one or whataboutism and pseudo-tolerance. In my opinion, that’s why this podcast resonates so much.\nGetting back on topic, the episode I’m referring to is Men, Women and the Road to Happiness. It’s in German, so if you have the privilege of understanding German, I highly recommend it.\nWhat struck me most was how modern society’s push for equality, while well-intentioned, sometimes translates into a forced homogenization that ignores fundamental biological realities. This is particularly evident in how we approach gender roles, relationships, and even our basic biology.\nWhile people talk about equality, what they are really talking about is equalization. I explain this by looking at what is actually meant by the word equality between the sexes. In my opinion, the problem with this whole social debate starts with the definition of equality. If you look it up in non-scientific encyclopedias like Wikipedia, it is defined as follows: “Equality generally refers to the fact of being equal, of having the same value.” (ao. 04/2025). While the word “equality” itself suggests that especially the first part of this definition is accurate, I believe it rather means: “The right to be equal” or “The concession of having the same rights”.\nThe difference is subtle, but note the little word “right”, in the sense of freedom to do something. The first part of the Wikipedia definition suggests that the two biological sexes are effectively the same, which is false. I agree with the second part. But I don’t know whether this is objectively the case in reality, so I won’t say any more here.\nSince this is the general definition of “equality” and I am writing specifically about gender equality, Wikipedia defines gender equality as “(…) the state of having equal access to resources and opportunities regardless of gender (…)”, which is definitely invalidates my prior interpretation to some extent and is far from the general definition.\nIn my opinion, however, this definition is used as a justification for gender equalization policies, which we see, for example, in the form of quotas for women. The emancipation process of women is the real driver in the background, although this process started hundreds of years ago. Emancipation and equality sound great, but what about when it actually comes to equalization? This is simply not possible, because men and women are not the same, they are biologically different.\nIf you bring these biologically different forms of the human species so close together, you will also distance them from their natural origins, to stay with the quote above. The social acceptance of the female man and the male woman dominates social attention.\nAnd the consequence of this is that both tend to become unhappier because they distance themselves from their original biology.\n","wordCount":"560","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://timonrieger.de/images/papermod-cover.png","datePublished":"2025-04-19T17:49:23+02:00","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://timonrieger.de/blog/biology-is-intentional/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"timonrieger.de","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://timonrieger.de/assets/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://timonrieger.de/ accesskey=h title="timonrieger.de (Alt + H)">timonrieger.de</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://timonrieger.de/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://timonrieger.de/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=https://timonrieger.de/blog/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://timonrieger.de/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://timonrieger.de/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://timonrieger.de/archive/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://timonrieger.de/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://timonrieger.de/blog/>Blog</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Biology Is Intentional</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-04-19 17:49:23 +0200 CEST'>Apr 19, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#quote-of-the-day aria-label="Quote Of The Day">Quote Of The Day</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>The other day, I came across a great video podcast that made me think about biologoy, relationships and happiness.
