I learned what emotions are and what they actually mean to me, how I would recognize them and how I can handle them. In this article, I will share my knowledge about emotions and how you can make use of them.\nQuote Of The Day In many cases, what you wish you knew ahead of time can only be learned after the decision is made. So there is nothing left but to pay attention to what you like, continue to iterate, and commit to making the most of each opportunity.\nEmotions are complex. Because of that, I think everyone should know about them. Not in the sense of how to avoid them or how to control them, but rather in the sense of what they mean to you and how you can make use of them. One of the first things you should understand is the fact that you as a human never wish for anything exterior but rather the emotions that arise from the exterior. This essentially means that whatever you do, is because you try to change the state of your feelings. By understanding this, you will be able to liberate yourself completely.\nHow emotions work Thoughts are the language of the mind. Emotions are the language of the soul. Emotions are the result of your thoughts. So if you want to change your emotions, you have to change your thoughts or the prerequisites that give rise to them.\nYour answer is decisive You have the power over your emotions. Not the circumstances. Not the people around you. Not the situation you are in. You have the power over your emotions by how you respond. This is called the principle of responseability.\nYou can visualize this by the following formula:\ncircumstances * answer^2 = emotions The answer is the only thing you can control. The circumstances are not in your control. The only thing you can control is your answer. And this is the key to understanding emotions.\nSolely by understanding this, you will be able to break free from the automatic and subconscious reactions that you have been conditioned with. You now enter the phase of learning how to react to the circumstances in a way that is most beneficial for you.\nHow to control your emotions","wordCount":"414","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/images/papermod-cover.png","datePublished":"2025-02-23T17:05:58+01:00","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/blog/how-to-stay-calm/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"timonrieger.de","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/assets/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="timonrieger.de (Alt + H)">timonrieger.de</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/blog/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/archive/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/photos/ title=Photos><span>Photos</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/blog/>Blog</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">How to Stay Calm
