Hey, I&rsquo;m Timon. I&rsquo;m a&mldr;

&mldr;life time learner by default
&mldr;work time software engineer or let&rsquo;s say tinkerer
&mldr;free time self-announced philosopher (does thinking count already?)

You will find me either working on projects, writing, photographing and occasionally tweeting.
While you might find me on other platforms, I am not active there.
Current Areas of Interest
Software
I originally started with Python and developed several web applications with Flask.
Although I really appreciate its simplicity and extensibility as a well-established micro web framework, it has its limitations.
Therefore, for my next project, I am turning to more flexible and advanced frameworks,
such as Litestar for the backend and Svelte for the frontend."><meta name=author content="Timon Rieger"><link rel=canonical href=https://website-slsg.onrender.com/about/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.a2aff6ee6596f3f4d4641a97ef2215e6a756b753c1fc5eed3ef59318e95ff298.css integrity="sha256-oq/27mWW8/TUZBqX7yIV5qdWt1PB/F7tPvWTGOlf8pg=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://website-slsg.onrender.com/assets/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://website-slsg.onrender.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://website-slsg.onrender.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://website-slsg.onrender.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://website-slsg.onrender.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://website-slsg.onrender.com/about/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://website-slsg.onrender.com/about/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="timonrieger.de"><meta property="og:title" content="About"><meta property="og:description" content="TL;DR Hey, I’m Timon.
