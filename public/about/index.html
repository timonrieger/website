Hey, I&rsquo;m Timon. I&rsquo;m a&mldr;

&mldr;life time learner
&mldr;work time software dev (or let&rsquo;s say tinkerer)
&mldr;free time self-announced philosopher (does thinking count already?)

You will find me either working on projects, writing, reading, photographing and occasionally tweeting.
If you want to get in touch, you can send me an email at contact@ and the domain of this site.
Principles
Inspired by The Zen of Python:

learning is fun
freedom in any way
emotions are power
silence is unvaluable

Current Areas of Interest
Software
I originally started with Python and developed several web applications with Flask.
Although I really appreciate its simplicity and extensibility as a well-established micro web framework, it has its limitations.
Therefore, for my next project, I am turning to more flexible and advanced frameworks,
such as Litestar for the backend and Svelte for the frontend."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=http://localhost:1313/about/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.2fe458a3004f8122f56c00eeaae85d03fd6036018b5ff83371839dbc87d5e2de.css integrity="sha256-L+RYowBPgSL1bADuquhdA/1gNgGLX/gzcYOdvIfV4t4=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=http://localhost:1313/assets/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=http://localhost:1313/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=http://localhost:1313/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=http://localhost:1313/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=http://localhost:1313/about/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="http://localhost:1313/about/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="timonrieger.de"><meta property="og:title" content="About"><meta property="og:description" content="TL;DR Hey, I’m Timon.
